# Portfolio-Challenge-02

## Description

This is another submission for the second week's challenge assignment for the USYD Coding Bootcamp. In this assignment we were tasked with creating a developer portfolio from scratch. This meant we had to build everything such as the HTML and CSS from the ground up.  While I enjoyed working on this task until the early mornings, there were plenty of fun and interesting obstacles that I had to work around.

Some obstacles that I faced during the challenge was where to start, how to make a webpage from scratch and how to use CSS to style said webpage. I overcame these obstacles by first building a wireframe on google slides to help consolidate my thoughts and plan what I would like my webpage would look like. All though it was confusing, constructing a wireframe really helped me with planning because I had a general idea of where I wanted to go. 

After the intial planning phase I then had to style it using CSS. Although the wireframe did help me a bunch, having so much freedom along with the wide variety of customisation made it difficult for me to really settle on a final design for the webpage. 

Although it was difficult, it's only been 2 weeks... meaning I have plenty more to learn and a lot more to add to this project once I get more familiar with HTML, CSS and eventually JavaScript. STAY TUNED!!
